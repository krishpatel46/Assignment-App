# Assignment App

This is an assignment for Andaz Kumar's Android Development Internship. It features the UI of a Profile Activity.

- Utilized XML to create UI, and Java to render data for certain UI components in runtime.

- Demonstrated a modular design approach where repetitive components are put in a separate XML layout file, and are reused in the main layout file.

- Material3 design instructions and components are effeciently used, along with creating an app theme.

- The primary buttons of the activity are made clickable to promote a sort of interactive UI (currently, a Toast pops up on button click).
